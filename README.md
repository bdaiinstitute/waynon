# Waynon - Calibration Tool

![Main GUI](assets/images/main_gui.png)

Waynon is a calibration tool that uses a GUI to help the user specify their problem. The user builds their scene graph by adding cameras, robots, and aruco markers. The scene graph is then used to build a factor graph that jointly optimizes the marker and camera locations. Currently only eye to hand is supported.

## Features
Construct your station by creating robots, cameras, and markers.
